⚓ About the Vault
"Ymir built the world from chaos; I craft code from coffee, AI, and sheer will."

Day Job: When I'm not inscribing digital runes, I'm the fearless captain steering my vessel through wild, rebellious seas—mastering both code and open waters.
Night Job: Architect of crypto bots, AI agents, and Solidity spells that rarely unleash Ragnarök-level bugs.
After Hours: Immersed in techno-infused nights where code meets club vibes, powered by caffeine and chaos. Each line of code is as sexy and unpredictable as a Valhalla afterparty.
🔍 Current Obsession: Training AI models to strategize like Vikings.
📖 Learning Quest: Teaching AI dad jokes without triggering kids' eye-roll reflex.

🚨 Fun Fact: My first smart contract, Fenrir's Leash, broke free after 3 hours—pure chaos, pure progress!
🧠 Secret Power: Explaining Merkle Trees with LEGO analogies—parental logic survived one brick at a time.

🤖 Crypto Constructs & AI Experiments
RagnarokBot: Automates trades while bellowing "TO VALHALLA!" in the logs.
MjolnirAI: GPT-powered AI evaluating Solidity contracts with Norse precision.
Odin’s Oracle: Predicting crypto market movements with Allfather clarity.
🎯 Quest Log
